# GitFrag

This is a little fun app that allows users to perform defragmentation (essentially sorting) of their GitHub profile contributions. It includes multiple sorting algorithms, so that users can observe their differences in efficiency. Additionally, every algorithm has a little explainer that showcases algorithm characteristics.
I build it as a challenge for my blog, and described my journey: https://www.chornonoh-vova.com/blog/gitfrag-challenge

Just navigate to https://gitfrag.vercel.app, sign in with your GitHub account, and try out different algorithms for defragmenting (sorting) your profile contributions!

And, additionaly, read about how all of those algorithms work!
